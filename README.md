# Reproduction of the implementation of an intrusion detection system based on convolutional neural network

In this repository, is presented the implementation of a "Convolutional neural network-based intrusion detection system for AVTP streams in automotive Ethernet-based networks" proposed by Seonghoon Jeong et al in their article [1].

In the "script_pcap_to_csv" file, the pcap files provided by the authors of [1] are processed. Then these files are used to create the model.
